### Sample Route Response
```json
{
  "route": ["Amsterdam_Central", "Jordaan", "Leidseplein", "Museumplein"],
  "total_distance_km": 2.6,
  "estimated_time_min": 8.1,
  "energy_used_kWh": 0.44,
  "confidence": 0.90,
  "ai_enhancement": {
    "confidence_score": 0.85,
    "reasoning": "AI analysis suggests this route is already well-optimized..."
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 🤖 AI Enhancement System
- **Confidence-Based Triggering**: AI agents called when algorithm confidence < 0.75
- **Dual AI Fallback**: DeepSeek (primary) → Groq (fallback) with retry logic
- **Intelligent Route Acceptance**: Based on improvement scores and metrics comparison
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to deterministic routes on AI failure

### 📍 Routing Integration  
- **Multi-Algorithm Support**: Dijkstra, A*, Multi-objective optimization
- **Driver Profile Integration**: ECO, BALANCED, AGGRESSIVE profiles
- **Battery Constraint Handling**: Charging stop optimization
- **Performance Metrics**: Distance, time, energy, emissions tracking

### 🗺️ Map Data Management
- **Graph Caching**: Memory and disk caching for performance  
- **Netherlands Enhancement**: Extended Amsterdam graph with major Dutch cities
- **API Integration**: OpenChargeMap API validation and data fetching
- **Fallback Handling**: Robust error handling with local graph fallbacks
